This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## High-level code architecture and structure

This repository is a collection of resources for learning Java security. It is not a typical software project with a build system or tests.

- **`README.md`**: The main file in this repository. It serves as a comprehensive guide for learning Java security, with links to articles, videos, and other resources.
- **`JavaSecurity/`**: This directory contains Java code examples related to various security topics. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific vulnerability or technology, such as `Fastjson/`, `Log4j2/`, `Weblogic/`, etc. These are meant for study and debugging.
- **`链子流程图/`**: This directory likely contains diagrams related to the "chains" of gadgets used in deserialization exploits.

## Commonly Used Commands

There are no standard build, lint, or test commands for this repository. The Java files are individual examples intended for learning and experimentation. You can compile and run them individually using `javac` and `java`.
