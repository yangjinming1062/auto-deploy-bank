# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of educational materials and source code examples focused on web security vulnerabilities in Java. It is structured as a series of articles, with each directory corresponding to a specific topic like SQL Injection, XSS, SSRF, etc.

## Code Architecture and Structure

- The repository is organized into directories, each named with a number and a description of the vulnerability it covers (e.g., `【02】SQL 漏洞原理与实际案例介绍/`).
- Each directory is self-contained and includes:
    - A Markdown file (`.md`) with a detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
    - Subdirectories containing related Java source code examples.
    - An `img` directory for images used in the markdown file.

## Development and Commands

- There are no global build, test, or linting commands for this repository.
- Each subdirectory should be treated as a separate project or set of examples.
- When working on a specific vulnerability, refer to the source code and instructions within that particular directory. The primary files to consult are the markdown files within each directory for context and explanation.
