## High-level code architecture and structure

This repository contains educational materials for Google Cloud Platform. The content is organized into three main categories:

*   `courses/`: In-depth courses on various Google Cloud topics.
*   `bootcamps/`: Hands-on bootcamps to learn specific skills.
*   `self-paced-labs/`: Labs to practice and apply your knowledge.

Each subdirectory within these categories contains a specific course, bootcamp, or lab. The content is primarily in the form of markdown files (`.md`) and Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).

There are no specific build, test, or lint commands for this repository. The primary task is to navigate the directory structure to find the relevant educational materials.
